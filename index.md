## Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures 
### CTP OTM 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Bruk3/bruk3.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

This is currently just a placeholder for the new github page that I'll be maintaining for my OTM mentees. The content of this page
will hopefully include a course plan for an intro to algorithms class. It will also be updated with: 


- **lesson articles**
- **coding exercises**
- **links to video tutorials**



1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Bruk3/bruk3.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
