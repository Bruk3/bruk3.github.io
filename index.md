## Intro to Algorithms and Programming Essentials 
### CTP OTM (Round 1)

### Objectives
- __Get introduced to some of the most fundamental data structures and classic algorithms in Computer Science__
    - Searching
    - Sorting
    - Arrays, Lists and Dictionaries
    - Stacks
    - Recursion 
    - Binary Trees
- __Learn some algorithm design and analysis techniques__
    - Time Complexity 
    - Space Complexity 
    - Divide and Conquer algorithms
- __Improve your python programming skills__ 
- __Get introduced to maintaining code using a Version Control System (Github)__
- __Learn how to get things done using a linux terminal__ (Optional)

### Prerequisites 
- Basic programming fundamentals (types, variables, loops, conditionals,functions, Time Complexity)
- Basic knowledge of coding in python 
- Acceptable typing speed 
- Passion and Self Motivaton 

#### Day 0
- Introduction 
- Expectations and Committment

### Tasks for Week 1

- __Setting up the Development Environment__ 
  - Install python 3.7 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbryl4MZJms&list=PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3&index=3)
  - Install Anaconda (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mDYijMfSzs)
- __Review Basic python programming (functions, while loops, for loops, conditionals (if, else, elif))__


#### Day 1 
- Check that the students have their dev environments set up properly. If they're having any troubles, ask them to share their screen and help them solve their issue. 
- __First Pair Programming__ 
    - Go to codeshare.io and quickly review the programming fundamentals. (Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Data types). An easy way to do this would be to write a holistic function of your choice that demonstrates all of the basics. Make sure you explain each line of code to the student as you write the function.
    - Now since we're assuming a programming background for the Algorithms students, the next task would be to ask them to implement a very simple function that requires loops and conditionals at the very least. This will ensure that the student is ready for taking the next lessons.
